# Event Details
## [TALK] Pinkie Pacts - Consumer Based Contract Testing with Kristian Scholze 

### Description: 
(30 mins) Integration tests are like throwing a wild party with all your friends, hoping everything goes smoothly. Contract testing is more like a civilized tea party, where everyone agrees on the rules and sips their code gracefully.

Let's get an overview on how to use contract testing to break integration tests into unittests to get faster feedback, clearer responsibilities and free interface documentation without sacrificing the safety we love.
We'll dive into the reasons why we think we need integration tests and if there is an easier way to accomplish them. Looking at a specific implementation we'll also see how to transform existing unit or integration test into a contract test and what advantages they bring.

### About Kristian Scholze
Professional Rubber Ducky; Software engineer by heart. Automation aficionado. Bug extinguisher extraordinaire.

## [WORKSHOP] An Introduction to Risk Modelling in Reinsurance, with Python with Rithika Adiga & Arielle Jocktane

### Description
This is a follow-up session from the one in September, where we'll go into what Risk Modelling in (Re)Insurance may look like, followed by a hands-on session where you'll create your first predicted cashflows to help underwriters assess risk.

This primarily uses stochastic modelling and not ML techniques.

There's spot prizes with Amazon gift cards to be won too!

Additional notes:

* Some knowledge of Github may be useful, but we will go over the basics if needed.
* Have access and can use an IDE/Jupyter for Python
* Participants should get their laptops and have access to an internet connection
* Prior Python experience isn't a must but could be helpful
* Targeted for beginners/intermediates
